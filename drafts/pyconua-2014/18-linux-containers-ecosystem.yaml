    Docker changed the way we do development and deployment. But
    most  people use it as a black box that do the job most of
    the time. This is  advanced level talk that explains how
    linux containers work in depth.  What new perspectives they
    open. And what new challenges they impose.  After this
    lecture you might be able to implement your own Docker or
    to build more sophisticated tools on top of linux
    containers.   It consists of three parts:   1. Internals of
    linux namespaces: system calls and other things behind
    containers  2. Overview of different container
    implementations: docker, lxc,  vagrant-lxc, nix...  3. New
    security challenges of namespaces with great emphasis on
    Docker  and clouds
