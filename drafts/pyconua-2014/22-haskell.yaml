    Python is a terrific everyday tool for solving practical tasks,
    but there always was a missing thing here and there.
    Vlad has tried many languages during his career as an engineer,
    got excited with a functional programming community and settled with using Haskell
    as a prime-time instrument. Come to the talk to find out what's going on.
    In this talk passion is going to be (almost) purely technical and no hello worlds, promise.
